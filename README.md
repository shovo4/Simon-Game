# Simon Game

## Overview
This project is a web-based version of the classic Simon game. It's a memory game where players follow an increasingly complex sequence of colors and sounds. Featuring a clean, responsive UI, this implementation uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- **Start/Restart Mechanism**: Game starts or restarts on spacebar press.
- **Interactive Interface**: Four colored buttons (red, blue, green, yellow) with corresponding sounds.
- **Score Tracking**: Current score displayed during gameplay; last score shown after game over.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Each level adds a new step to the sequence.

## How to Play
1. Press the spacebar to start the game.
2. Observe the sequence of colors and sounds.
3. Click the buttons in the same order as the sequence.
4. The game progresses to a new level with each successful sequence replication.
5. Pressing the wrong color ends the game; score is displayed and the game can be restarted with the spacebar.

## Installation
To play the game, clone the repository and open `index.html` in a web browser.
